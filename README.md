- ðŸ“– I'm interested on learning quantum computing, and I'm using IBM Quantum Lab to start learning how to code for it. Because of this I'm also learning Python.

- ðŸŽ¸ An interesting fact about me is that, even though formally I'm not in any band right now, I've been helping out a band called Los Flanger Mingos to demo some stuff and upload it to Spotify because we have a band called Mantequilla BlÃ¼, but it's currently in hiatus, however, we just love making music. [You can listen to their latest material on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0DSE7pSC74sXUODsHQNEaF).
